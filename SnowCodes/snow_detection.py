2 step program: 
    1. Reads input Sentinel 2 satellite images and first merges the B02, B03, B04 and B11 raster bands from 2 satellites
     (TDL and TDK) and the clips the merged raster to the boundary shapefile and then resamples them to a 25x25 cell
      resolution .tif raster
    2. Reads the band data from each resampled raster band to arrays and determines which areas corresponds to snow in
     the satellite images.
NOTES: 
- Main function "calculate_snow_cover" does all the calculations for one sensing date at a time. 
- Program can be run individually or through "SnowCode_Main"
- Program generates a binary raster, where 1 means there is snow presence, and 0 means there is none. 
- An error is generates if any of the needed bands (02, 03, 04, 11) are not available. If the TCI rasters are not 
available, the program will skip this step, since it is not necessary for the calculations. 

Input files: [In Input_configuration]
1. SI_folder_path: Folder with satellite images for a given date: folder must have a subfolder for each satellite 
(e.g. one for TDL and one for TDK)
2. image_list: Name of bands to merge, clip and resample. The name in the list must correspond to the final suffix of 
the satellite image name (DO NOT CHANGE)
3. image_location_folder_name: Name of the folder in which the satellite images are directly located (IMG_DATA)
4. shape_path: path (location in folder + name.shp) of the shapefile with which to clip the resampled rastersshape file: 
5. Thresholds for snow detection (NDSI, Red and Blue)
