File reads input Sentinel 2 satellite images and first merges the B02, B03, B04 and B11 raster bands from 2 satellites
(TDL and TDK) and the clips the merged raster to the boundary shapefile and then resamples them to a 25x25 cell
resolution .tif raster (to match other input raster files)

Receives one folder at a time, corresponding to 1 sensing date, and reads Sentinel 2 satellite images for the given, 
sensing dates. Images corresponding to different satellites (e.g. TDL and TDK) must be in different folders within the 
main sensing date folder, and the satellite images must be in a folder, whose name is a user input under the variable 
'image_location_folder_name'. 

File can be called individually or through the main.py file. 

Needed input files: [in config_input]
1. SI_folder_path: Folder with satellite images for a given date: folder must have a subfolder for each satellite 
(e.g. one for TDL and one for TDK)
2. image_list: Name of bands to merge, clip and resample. The name in the list must correspond to the final suffix of 
the satellite image name (DO NOT CHANGE)
3. image_location_folder_name: Name of the folder in which the satellite images are directly located (IMG_DATA)
4. shape_path: path (location in folder + name.shp) of the shapefile with which to clip the resampled rastersshape file:

    Function loops through each file in the folder "path" and looks for the file whose last 3 digits correspond to

     04, or 11) it generates an error. If it corresponds to "TCI", it is not necessary for calculation purposes so it
